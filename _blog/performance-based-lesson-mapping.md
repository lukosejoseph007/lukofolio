## Introduction
This chapter introduces a systematic approach to instructional design, emphasizing the importance of performance and practical application. It draws upon the work of thought leaders in performance improvement and instructional design. The methodology presented here focuses on **aligning learning activities with desired performance outcomes**, ensuring that instruction is relevant, effective, and contributes to real-world competence. This approach emphasizes the need to move beyond simply delivering content and instead focuses on **creating learning experiences that transfer to the job** and have a positive impact on performance.

## Key Concepts

### Performance Competence
- **Performance competence** is defined as the **ability to perform tasks and produce outputs that meet stakeholder requirements**. This definition is influenced by the work of Tom Gilbert and his focus on accomplishments and worthy outputs. It moves beyond simply having knowledge and skills to a focus on achieving specific, measurable results.
- Instructional design should aim to develop performance confidence that not only exists within the training environment but also **transfers to the job** and leads to a positive impact.
- It is important to consider the **life cycle costs** of instructional materials, especially if the content is volatile and requires frequent updates. Sometimes, informal learning approaches are more appropriate than formal training.

### The Importance of Job Aids
- Guidance, often in the form of job aids, can be a valuable alternative to forcing memorization.
- It is important to analyze the performance context to determine if a **memorized performance response** is necessary or if a **referenced performance response** using job aids is sufficient.
- Standalone job aids may not be embraced by all clients; therefore, embedding them within training programs may be more useful.

### Lesson Mapping
- **Lesson mapping** is a structured approach to designing instruction, consisting of three primary components:
  1. **Information:** What learners need to know.
  2. **Demonstration:** Showing learners how to apply what they need to know.
  3. **Application:** Practice and feedback to hone skills and develop memory.
- The lesson map is one of three design tools, along with the event map, which provides a high-level view of the instruction:
  - The **event map** is a high-level overview of the entire instructional event, showing the sequence of lessons.
  - The **lesson map** breaks down each lesson into specific instructional activities, within the info, demo, and application format.
  - The **instructional activity specification** details every component of the lesson map, including specifics of the content, delivery method, and source materials.
- Each lesson should include an opening that states objectives, connects to prior knowledge, and a close with a debrief.

## Data Sources for Lesson Mapping
Lesson mapping is based on data from two primary sources:

### Performance Model
- The **performance model** captures what the outputs are, how to measure a good output versus a bad output, tasks, and roles and responsibilities.
- The performance model is generated with a group of master performers and subject matter experts and captures ideal performance, typical performance gaps, and their probable causes.
  - It is important to identify the typical performance gaps and the barriers to ideal performance that learners will face.
  - Gap causes can be related to deficiencies in the environment, knowledge, skills, individual attributes, or the process itself.
- There is at least one performance model for every area of performance.

### Enabling Knowledge and Skills
- This data is systematically derived from the performance model data.
- The enabling knowledge and skills are linked back to areas of performance.
- Analysis includes whether the knowledge or skill should be selected for, trained, how critical it is, how difficult to learn, and how volatile it is.
- A systematic process is used to identify the knowledge and skills required.

## Practical Application of Lesson Mapping

### Designing Instruction
- The lesson map is designed with a team using data from the performance model and knowledge and skills matrices.
- Learning objectives are related to post-learning performance objectives, which emphasize what learners will be able to do.
- Application exercises should provide learners with opportunities to practice what they have learned with feedback.
- Existing content should be reused when possible.

### Barriers to Transfer
- Instructional design should address barriers that learners may face in transferring their skills back to their jobs.
- Barriers can be related to the environment, management support, or other external factors.
- By identifying barriers to performance, instructors can help learners develop strategies to overcome these challenges.

### Identifying Master Performers
- **Master performers** have fluency and do things well and quickly.
- They should be chosen by stakeholders based on their high level of performance.
- Using master performers ensures that the training material is based on best practices.

### Addressing New Capabilities
- When dealing with new capabilities, it is necessary to bring in experts and rely on best guesses, knowing that maintenance and updates may be necessary.

### Avoiding Analysis Paralysis
- The analysis process should be efficient and should not be overly drawn out. A short, focused analysis of 1 to 3 days is best.
- A well-defined process that uses the performance model and knowledge and skills matrices can prevent analysis paralysis.

## Conclusion
Performance-based lesson mapping is a powerful tool for designing effective learning experiences. By focusing on desired outcomes, using data-driven analysis, and engaging master performers, learning experience designers can create instruction that not only imparts knowledge and skills but also leads to measurable performance improvement. This approach ensures that training is relevant, practical, and valuable to both learners and organizations.

This approach to lesson mapping was developed and refined over decades of practice and is intended to serve as a starting point for a rigorous instructional design approach. It may be adapted to meet the needs of specific contexts.
