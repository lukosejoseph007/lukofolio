## Introduction
A key challenge for Learning Experience Design (LXD) professionals is determining whether a performance issue stems from a lack of knowledge or skills that can be addressed through training, or from systemic problems like flawed processes, inadequate tools, or misaligned incentives. This chapter will guide you through the process of differentiating between training problems and system problems, explore strategies for identifying and addressing systemic issues, and examine the role of the learning designer as a systems thinker. It will emphasize the importance of a holistic approach to performance improvement, and understanding that sometimes training is not the answer.

## Differentiating Between Training Problems and System Problems
It's essential to distinguish between problems that training can effectively address and those rooted in the system itself. Here's how to approach this differentiation:

### Training Problems
These arise when individuals lack the necessary knowledge, skills, or abilities to perform a task effectively.

#### Examples
- Employees don't know how to use new software.
- They are not familiar with a new safety procedure.

These are situations that training can address by filling knowledge or skill gaps.

### System Problems
These stem from issues within the work environment, such as broken processes, poor user interfaces, misaligned incentives, or a lack of resources.

#### Examples
- A computer system is difficult to use.
- Incentives prioritize speed over accuracy.
- There's a lack of feedback.

These are situations where training alone will not fix the problem, and the problem requires system-level changes.

It is important to note that often problems exist at the intersection of both training and system issues.

## Identifying Systemic Issues
To identify systemic issues that hinder learning transfer and performance, consider these strategies:

- **Observe and Analyze**: Do a thorough analysis of the work environment. Observe individuals performing tasks, and note any difficulties or inefficiencies. Look for patterns of errors, delays, or workarounds that may indicate systemic problems.
- **Talk to Stakeholders**: Engage with subject matter experts, managers, and employees to gather insights and understand their experiences. Ask about the challenges they face, the tools and resources they use, and the incentives that influence their behavior.
- **Review Processes and Workflows**: Examine the existing procedures, processes, and workflows. Identify any bottlenecks, redundancies, or confusing steps that may contribute to performance issues. Are the steps clear and easy to follow, or are they prone to error and inefficiency?
- **Examine the Technology**: Evaluate the technology and tools that people use. Are they user-friendly? Are they designed to support performance, or do they create additional challenges? Look for opportunities to streamline the technology or provide better interfaces that support effective performance.
- **Evaluate Feedback and Incentives**: Are there mechanisms in place to provide individuals with feedback on their performance? Are they getting feedback from their managers, the systems they use, or their colleagues? Is the feedback timely, specific, and constructive? Also, check if the incentive system aligns with the desired behaviors. If people are rewarded for one behavior and are asked to change their behavior, this can cause problems. It is important to make sure that incentive systems support the behaviors being taught.
- **Look for Learned Helplessness**: Look for places where people have tried to do the right thing and have been punished for it.

## Addressing Systemic Issues
Once systemic issues have been identified, learning designers should advocate for changes that support improved performance.

- **Advocate for System Improvements**: The role of the learning designer extends beyond creating training; it includes advocating for system-level changes. Work with stakeholders to implement better processes, user-friendly tools, and aligned incentives.
- **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Learning designers can help stakeholders understand the impact of systems on performance. When the stakeholders understand the problem, they are more likely to address it.
- **Focus on Performance Support**: Provide job aids, checklists, or other resources that can help employees perform tasks correctly. Job aids should be designed to provide information in the moment it's needed.
- **Create Feedback Mechanisms**: Incorporate feedback mechanisms in digital learning environments, and focus on ways that people can get feedback from managers and peers.
- **Provide Training and Support**: While training may not solve system problems on its own, it's an essential part of the solution. Make sure the training addresses the human and technical factors, and that the training includes opportunities for practice with feedback.

## The Learning Designer as a Systems Thinker
The sources emphasize that learning designers need to think like systems thinkers, understanding how different elements of a system impact overall performance. This requires:

- **A Holistic Perspective**: Consider all factors that influence performance, including individual capabilities, team dynamics, organizational culture, and the work environment.
- **Understanding Interdependencies**: Understand how different parts of the system influence each other. Changes in one area can have unintended consequences in other areas, and this should be taken into account.
- **A Focus on Root Causes**: Learning designers should look for the root causes of performance issues, rather than simply addressing the symptoms. This requires a deep analysis and a holistic understanding of the system.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Systems thinking emphasizes continuous improvement rather than a one-time fix. Learning designers should continually assess systems and look for opportunities to improve them.

## Case Study Example
A call center is experiencing low customer satisfaction scores. Analysis reveals that the call center staff is trained in customer service procedures, but the system they use is slow, difficult to navigate, and frequently malfunctions. Additionally, the incentive system rewards call volume, not customer satisfaction. In this case, training alone will not solve the problem. The learning designer would need to advocate for improvements to the call center system, such as a more user-friendly interface, updated processes, and a revised incentive system that rewards customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
Differentiating between training and system problems is critical for effective learning experience design. Learning designers need to be able to identify both the gaps in knowledge and skills that can be addressed through training, and the systemic issues that may be the cause of performance problems. By adopting a systems-thinking approach, LXD professionals can design holistic solutions that truly improve performance and learning transfer. This means understanding that training is not always the solution to a problem, and that sometimes the system must be changed to improve performance.
